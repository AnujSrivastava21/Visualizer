            <!-- Details about a Queue -->
            <p class="paragraph">A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). It's often used in computer science for tasks like process scheduling and breadth-first search algorithms.
                <p class="paragraph1">Enqueue (Adding an element to the rear):
                    Time Complexity: O(1)
                    In an array-based implementation, you can enqueue an element by simply adding it to the end of the array. This is a constant-time operation</p>
                <p class="paragraph1">equeue (Removing an element from the front):
                    Time Complexity: O(n)
                    In an array-based implementation, dequeuing requires shifting all remaining elements to fill the gap left by the removed element. This results in a linear time operation, as you have to move n-1 elements in the worst case.</p>
