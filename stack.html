            <!-- Details about a stack -->
            <p class="paragraph">A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end called the top. It's often used in computer science for tasks like function call management and expression evaluation.
             <p class="paragraph1">Push: O(1) - Adding an element to the top of the stack is a constant time operation because you are simply adding an element to the end of the array or linked list.</p>
             <p class="paragraph1">Pop: O(1) - Removing the top element from the stack is also a constant time operation because you are just removing the last element from the array or linked list.</p>   
             <p class="paragraph1">Peek (Top): O(1) - Checking the top element of the stack (without removing it) is a constant time operation because you are accessing the last element directly.
